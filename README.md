This repository contains a [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) app that displays [FlatAnwendungshandbuch](https://mig-ahb-utility-stack.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/maus.models.html#maus.models.anwendungshandbuch.FlatAnwendungshandbuch)s which are generated by [kohlrahbi](https://github.com/Hochfrequenz/kohlrahbi/).
The data which are displayed are loaded from the submodule [`machine-readable_anwendungshandbuecher`](https://github.com/Hochfrequenz/machine-readable_anwendungshandbuecher).

## CI / CD

The app is deployed as Static Web App.
Its resource group is `kohlrahbi`.
Its name is [`ahbesser`](https://portal.azure.com/#@hochfrequenz.net/resource/subscriptions/1cdc65f0-62d2-4770-be11-9ec1da950c81/resourcegroups/kohlrahbi/providers/Microsoft.Web/staticSites/ahbesser/staticsite).
The main branch is automatically deployed to [`purple-glacier-0bd2a2403.2.azurestaticapps.net/`](https://purple-glacier-0bd2a2403.2.azurestaticapps.net/).

## Rationale

German utilities exchange data using [EDIFACT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EDIFACT), a standardized format for market communication.
The technical regulations for this communication are published by the _Forum Datenformate_ of the BDEW on [`edi-energy.de`](https://www.edi-energy.de/).
However, these regulations, known as "**A**nwendungs**h**and**b**Ã¼chern" (AHBs), are often difficult to access and work with.

AHBs are lengthy tables that describe the information utilities need to exchange for specific business processes.
With regulations spanning thousands of pages, finding specific information within these AHBs can be a daunting task.
The AHBs are published as PDF or Word files, making it challenging to automatically extract information, compare versions, or test APIs against the rules described in the AHBs.

To address these challenges, the project aims to make the AHBs more accessible and user-friendly.
By providing a user interface, users can easily search for specific "pruefidentifikator" instead of manually searching through hundreds or even thousands of pages. This will greatly simplify the process of accessing and utilizing the information contained within the AHBs.

The project's goal is to enhance the digitization of AHBs, enabling automated extraction, comparison, testing, and visualization of the information.
By transforming the unstructured PDF or Word format into a more structured and intuitive interface, users can efficiently navigate and utilize the AHBs for their specific needs.
